# Getting Started with Cocktail Land app with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

With this app you can search for cocktail recipes and see them on pictures. We used the [Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). After registration and login, you can access more features like savibg your favorite cocktails and even making your own.

This app is the frontend part of the Cocktail Land project.
